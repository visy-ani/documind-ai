## 📋 Detailed Issues List

### **ISSUE #1: Dashboard Document Count Incorrect**

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium  
**Category:** Data Sync  
**Page:** Dashboard  

**Description:**  
Dashboard stats card shows "0" uploaded documents when user actually has 2 documents.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Log in to account with existing documents
2. View dashboard
3. Observe "Uploaded Documents" stat

**Expected Behavior:**  
Should show "2" uploaded documents

**Actual Behavior:**  
Shows "0" uploaded documents

**Impact:**  
- Misleading statistics
- User confusion
- Affects onboarding experience (getting started checklist)

**Suggested Fix:**  
Update dashboard stats query to properly count documents for the logged-in user. Check the database query or API call that fetches document count.

**Files Likely Involved:**
- `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Dashboard stats fetching logic
- API route or server action for stats

---

### **ISSUE #2: Dashboard Shows Empty State When Documents Exist**

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium  
**Category:** UI/Logic  
**Page:** Dashboard  

**Description:**  
Dashboard displays "No documents yet" empty state even though user has 2 documents uploaded.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Log in to account with existing documents
2. View dashboard
3. Scroll down to main content area

**Expected Behavior:**  
- Should show recent documents list OR
- Should acknowledge documents exist OR
- Should hide empty state when documents > 0

**Actual Behavior:**  
Shows empty state with upload prompt despite having documents

**Impact:**  
- Confusing user experience
- Contradicts the "View Documents" option
- Makes platform seem non-functional

**Suggested Fix:**  
Add conditional rendering:
```typescript
{documentCount === 0 ? (
  <EmptyState />
) : (
  <RecentDocuments documents={recentDocs} />
)}
```

---

### **ISSUE #3: AI Queries Count Shows Zero**

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium  
**Category:** Data Sync  
**Page:** Dashboard  

**Description:**  
Dashboard stats show "0" AI Queries Run when user has run multiple queries.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Log in (user has run queries before)
2. View dashboard stats
3. Observe "AI Queries Run" stat

**Expected Behavior:**  
Should show actual count of AI queries (at least 2+)

**Actual Behavior:**  
Shows "0"

**Impact:**  
- Inaccurate statistics
- Missing user engagement metrics

**Suggested Fix:**  
Update dashboard query to count AI queries from database. Check `AIQuery` table count for current user.

---

### **ISSUE #4: Sidebar Missing on Documents Page**

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium  
**Category:** UI Consistency  
**Page:** Documents List  

**Description:**  
Sidebar navigation disappears when navigating to /documents page, making navigation inconsistent.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Start on dashboard (sidebar visible)
2. Click "My Documents" or navigate to /documents
3. Observe sidebar is gone

**Expected Behavior:**  
Sidebar should remain visible on all pages for consistent navigation

**Actual Behavior:**  
Sidebar only shows on dashboard, disappears on other pages

**Impact:**  
- Inconsistent user experience
- Makes navigation harder
- Users have to use back button or type URLs

**Suggested Fix:**  
Ensure documents page uses the same layout component as dashboard. Check if documents page is using different layout or missing layout wrapper.

**Files Likely Involved:**
- `app/(dashboard)/documents/page.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`
- Layout configuration
